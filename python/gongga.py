"""A client for the harness, with one function per command.

The harness is a server that answers commands by name; this module puts those
names on an object, so a Python program says what it means instead of building a
command line and reading JSON off stdout:

    import gongga

    server = gongga.connect()                       # from GONGGA_SERVER / the home
    server.set_session(id="main", cwd="/tmp")       # a command, its arguments by name
    server.send_message(session="main", message="go")  # refuse -> GonggaError, with the reason
    for session in server.sessions:                 # what the server published
        print(session["name"])

    server.call("get_messages", session="main", range="-5:")   # a Reply, not an exception

Which names exist is the server's answer, not this file's: the greeting carries
the catalog, and a name it does not publish raises `AttributeError` here rather
than travelling to the server to be refused. That is the same rule the command
line follows -- this module knows no command.

Arguments are the command's own: a string is a string, a list arrives as JSON for
an argument the schema types as a list, and an argument the server requires must
be present, or the server says so. The one convenience is `session`: a command
that acts on a session takes it by name like any other argument.

The four commands SPEC's `## Python Cmd` names are commands like the rest, so a
package skill calls them the same way:

    server.ls_skill(path="harness", session="main")        # -> its id, bucket, SKILL.md
    server.run_skill(id="harness/prefix-cache",            # one function of a package
                     cmd={"name": "look", "args": {"path": "/tmp"}},
                     session="main")
    server.get_messages(session="main", range="-20:-1")    # a range of the transcript
    server.clone_session(id="main", new_id="main-copy")    # a copy that runs its own turns
