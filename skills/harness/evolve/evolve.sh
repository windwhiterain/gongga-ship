# Self-evolution: replace the server that is running you.
#
# The pieces already exist, they were just never wired together:
#
#   * `cancel` stops the server but *keeps* the running turn as a pending task
#     (`commands.rs::cancel_and_preserve`), and the next start replays it;
#   * a detached job outlives the server that started it, which is what lets a
#     successor wait outside the process it is about to replace;
#   * `server.lock` is a pid file, so the home is handed over rather than
#     stolen, and a stale pid is recognised as litter.
#
# What was missing is one command that does the swap in the safe order: stage
# the new binary, start the successor *before* stopping the old server (so a
# bad build costs nothing), and only then cancel.
#
#   $GONGGA_HOME/skills/evolve/evolve.sh stage            # test, build, stage, write launcher
#   bash --detached: <the launcher it printed>
#   $GONGGA_HOME/skills/evolve/evolve.sh swap <stamp>     # verify the successor, then cancel
#   $GONGGA_HOME/skills/evolve/evolve.sh status           # what is staged, who is waiting
#   $GONGGA_HOME/skills/evolve/evolve.sh clean            # kill successors nobody is going to swap
#
# Only the newest stage may take the home. `stage` writes `.dev/evolve-current`,
# a launcher whose stamp is not in there leaves the waiting loop instead of
# racing for the port, and `swap` refuses a stamp that is not current. Without
# that pointer a waiter from an abandoned attempt keeps polling `tasklist` and
# `netstat` five times a second for as long as the old server lives -- forever,
# if nobody was going to swap it -- and when the port finally frees, the *older*
# binary can be the one that wins the race.
#
# After `swap` this turn is cancelled and preserved; the successor binds the
# port, picks the pending turn up and asks the model to continue. That is the
# whole loop: the harness replaces the process that is running it.
#
# See DESIGN.md §10 for why the order matters and what is still missing.
