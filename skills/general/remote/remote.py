"""Run commands and move files on remote machines, without a client library.

Why this exists: driving a remote host over ssh is easy to do badly, and the failures
are quiet. Output arrives in an encoding nobody declared, an exit code becomes 1, a
quote gets eaten by one of three shells, or the call hangs forever because ssh
inherited a stdin that never closes. Each of those costs a debugging session, and none
of them is about the remote machine at all.

So the shape here is deliberate:

  * A script is sent as base64 and written to a file on the remote side before it runs.
    Nothing about it passes through a shell's parser on the way, so there is no quoting
    layer to get wrong -- the same reason `-EncodedCommand` exists on Windows, applied
    once for every shell family.
  * Output comes back base64-framed, so it is bytes rather than "text in whatever code
    page the remote console had". A GBK Windows console no longer produces mojibake.
  * The exit code is carried explicitly in the reply, because a channel that only
    reports "ssh failed" loses the difference between 1 and 7.
  * stdin is never inherited: either the transport owns it (a session) or it is
    /dev/null (a one-shot). The caller's stdin is a pipe that may never close.

Two paths, one transport:

  * one-shot -- one ssh per call, ~0.9 s here, and it always works;
  * session  -- one ssh held open per target, ~20-40 ms per call, used when it can be.

The session is an optimization on top of the one-shot, never a dependency: if it is
unavailable, dead, or was never started, the same command goes through the one-shot
path and says so.

Nothing here reads ~/.ssh/config, a roster, or any other local convention. A target is
whatever you tell it: host, port, user, identity. Store it once and it is just a name.
